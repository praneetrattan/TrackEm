# TrackEm


**NOTE:** *Project is currently under progress..*

##Description:
The utility of this app is to provide the user a simplistic way of tracking of all their daily activities,
without having to deal with multiple planner apps.

"I cheated on my diet today".. (*WeightWatchers*) <br>
"However, I did take all my medications".. (*Medisafe*) <br>
"John changed the HVAC air filter too".. (*Google calander*) <br>
"Fido really enjoyed the dogpark today, I should take him there more often".. (*PetPlanner*) <br>

No need to track these in their designated apps and planners!

The user can track multiple events in this one single app. Just differentiate by different icons..
The user is given the freedom to associate any icon with any event.

The visual representation of these icons is a simple way to summarize and track your day.

###Initial Workflow:
- User logs in for the first time -> show monthly Calender, highlighting today's date
- User clicks on a date -> Show Iconer, with any existing events.
- User clicks Add -> Show list of icons and let the user add an event against any of them.
- Save the icon-event mapping to user's profile.
